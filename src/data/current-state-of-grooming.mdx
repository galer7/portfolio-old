# The current state of grooming

I've recently joined a new team at Thinslices, working on a very cool project involving satellite communication and managing services that use it.

One of the issues that I've rediscovered after a short break while job hunting, was the inefficiency of the grooming/refinement meeting.

The inefficiency of this meeting comes from the fact that the thinking process is bottlenecked by the preservation process in an issue-tracking system. Yes, the engineers discuss the problem at hand and come up with technical solutions with regard to the current project state, but they should not be limited to that.

In this frequent scenario, a lot of details are also lost! The entire team is struggling to decipher the notes of a person that is not implementing said tasks.

So, these only 2 solutions come to mind:
1. Each engineer takes notes in [_their preferred note-taking app_], thus effort is not scaling, but you can achieve a higher SNR for tasks (not applicable to junior devs)
2. You use software that allows collaborative effort in real-time (Miro comes to mind). A big disadvantage here is that there is no attention channeling and people will mindlessly move like cattle trying to find the focus of discussion on the page.
3. While searching on the internet, I've found an asynchronous way for the grooming meeting, detailed [here](https://backstage.payfit.com/asynchronous-backlog-grooming/), where the process is moved to a Slack channel, and each member thinks of the problem on its own.
