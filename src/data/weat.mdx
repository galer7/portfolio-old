## 🧪 Tech stack

For this project I've used Next.js and TailwindCSS for the front-end + server-side rendered pages, and Socket.IO for the backend, both types in TypeScript.
The Next.js app is deployed on Vercel, while the WebSocket server is deployed on fly.io, using a simple multi-stage Dockerfile.

## 🐾 First steps: Next.js app

I've started this project with little to no experience in Next.js, React and/or TailwindCSS (pretty much anything frontend really).
This is also the first project I've completed using TypeScript.

When I've finished a first version Next.js project structure, I had two very large components, as I was using online `useState` variables, and since I was also using `useEffect` for receiving/transmitting WS messages, I didn't know how to maintain functionality after breaking into smaller components.
